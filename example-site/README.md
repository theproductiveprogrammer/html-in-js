# Example Site

This site uses [index.js](./index.js) and the [src/](./src) contents to generate a site using the [html-in-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-in-js) approach along with some [helper functions](../README.md#sample-helper-functions)

You can browse HTML generated from the site by clicking on the [index.html](https://github.com/theproductiveprogrammer/html-in-js/blob/master/example-site/index.html)

This site will pick up content from the `src/` folder automatically and generate a poem-browsing website from it.
